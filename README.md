<h2>
Tetris with Stack Implementation
</h2>

We will be reimplementing the game Tetris to be played and run with Processing. It will implement the concept of stacks that we learned this term. The tetromino shapes will be stored in a stack and popped off one by one as they begin falling down. If the QUEUE is depleted new random tetrominoes will be pushed in. Choosing to use a stack is also helpful because it allows us to be always aware of what the topmost element is. We can then utilize this to display what piece will appear next.

Our implementation of Tetris will follow the classic gameâ€™s rules and goals-- you rotate and move the tetrominoes to try and fill horizontal lines. We will include a scorekeeping display as well as a point bonus for accelerating the descent of the shapes. We are thinking about maybe using queues to implement a high score system. As previously stated, we will also have a display that shows the player what tetromino will get popped off and appear next. The game ends once a placed tetromino reaches the top of the grid.
